# Summary Flow Chart

![](images/Methodology Flow Chart Final.png)We chose to set our project CRS as EPSG:3197 as it is the CRS with the smallest extent that includes our study area.

# Data Download

-   [HumData Health Facilities](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_lby_health_facilities) (polygons) → Hospitals

    -   Don't include clinics as they overlap with hospitals, the other is within the flood extent  

-   [Copernicus EMSR roads](https://rapidmapping.emergency.copernicus.eu/EMSR696/download) to determine usable roads during/after the flood.

    -   Download the "AOI base layers" (aka BLP, used in the before scenario) and "Crisis Information" (aka GRA, used in the during and after scenario) under Derna's tab.

-   [Satellite data from OpenAerialMap](https://map.openaerialmap.org/#/-18.720703125,18.47960905583197,3?_k=z5qauk)

    -   [13 September 2023](https://map.openaerialmap.org/#/22.679643630981445,32.76151084292581,13/square/122102220201/65029d220906de000167e685?_k=85b9od)

    -   From the main page, zoom in to Libya and to Derna city. Afterwards, select the relevant date(latest data as of creation of report was 13 September 2023). Then download accordingly.

# Data Preparation and Cleaning

From the downloaded data:

-   Import the Analytical Hexagon of Derna.

-   Import from Humanitarian Data Exchange portal

    -   Import the latest flood extent

    -   Import health facilities 

-   Import from OSM

    -   Points of Interest(poi)

    -   Roads

    -   Places of Worship(pofw)

## Health Facilities

Imported health_facilities_polygon(hospitals)

-   Clip by extent using Derna hexagon layer to obtain hospitals in Derna
-   Open the attribute table
-   Double click to input المستشفى الشاعري الألماني for the feature with null value as its name. 
-   Untoggle editing mode using the pencil icon to save the changes

Save to geopackage:

Health facilities(save as hospitals)

## Shelters

-   Import OSM points of interest, and OSM places of worship. 

-   From Menu Bar, open Vector → Geoprocessing Tools → Clip 

-   Clip each of the two layer using the Derna hexagon layer. Rename them to derna_poi and derna_pofw.

-   Click once on derna_poi, then click on 'Select by expression'.

-   Type the following expression: "fclass" in ( 'community_centre' , 'school' , 'hotel' , 'college' , 'guesthouse' )

-   Export Selected Features from derna_poi as evacuation, using the project CRS.

-   From the Menu tab, go to Vector → Geoprocessing tools → Union

-   Select evacuation and derna_pofw as the input and overlay layers. Click 'Run', then click 'Close' if it ran successfully.

-   Open the attribute table of the temporary union layer.

Cleaning up the fields

-   Click on Field Calculator icon

-   Check the 'Update Existing field' checkbox.

-   Type the expression coalesce("field","field_2")e.g. For OSM_ID, coalesce("osm_id","osm_id_2")

    -   Use the expression \@id for fid

-   Then click 'OK.'

-   Repeat the above steps for code, fclass, name, and fid.

-   Untoggle the pencil icon to save the changes.

-   Close the attribute table.

-   In the layers panel, double click on the union layer to open its properties.

-   Navigate to fields.

-   Click on the pencil icon to toggle editing mode.

-   Select all the fields that end with "\_2."

    ![](images/shelters2.png)

-   Click on the delete field icon ![](images/shelters3.png).

-   Untoggle the pencil icon to save changes

-   Click 'Apply' then 'OK' to apply the changes and close the properties window.

-   Open the attribute table

-   Double click to input مسجد موسى بن نُصير (shelter 13) and مسجد ابو بكر الصديق  (shelter 11) for the feature with null value as its name. If uncertain which to input, you may compare the location with Google map to find the correct name. 

-   Untoggle editing mode using the pencil icon to save the changes

-   Right click on the union layer and export it to the geopackage as shelters, with EPSG 3197. Set geometry as Point.

-   Remove the temporary layer, original evacuation layer, and original pofw layer.

## Centroids

Data Used:

-   BLP transportationL (lines) layer from EMSR

-   OSM landuse

-   Flood extent (from humdata)

-   XYZ tiles osm map

Processing → Toolbox. Search for 'Polygonize' and select the one under Vector geometry (not the one under GDAL Raster conversion).

![](images/c1.png)

-   Set the EMSR BLP transportationL layer as the input

    ![](images/c2-01.png)

-   From the menu bar, go to Vector -\> Geoprocessing tools -\> Clip.

-   Select the polygonised layer as input and flood_extent as overlay layer

    ![](images/c3.png)

-   Save as flood extent neighbourhoods, EPSG 3197

-   Remove the temporary clipped and polygon layers

-   Load the gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1 layer

-   Select by Expression:

    "fclass" = 'residential'.

-   Close the selection window

-   From menu bar, go to Vector → Geoprocessing Tools → Clip

    ![](images/c4.png)

    ![](images/c5.png)

    ![](images/image111.png)

    ![](images/image26.png)

-   Install real centroid if you have not.

-   Browse for somewhere to save the output shapefile

    ![](images/image71.png)

Notice there are additional silvers we need to remove.

-   In the main project window, set the clipped layer on top of the OSM XYZ tile background

-   Right click the layer from the layer panel and open attribute table

-   Click on Field Calculator. 

-   Create a new field titled area, with decimal field type, using the expression \$area

    ![](images/image166.png)

-   Sort the field from the smallest to largest area

-   Starting from the smallest area, select the topmost row.

-   Click on the pencil icon to toggle editing mode if it is not already turned on

    ![](images/image129.png)

-   In main project panel, right click and click Zoom to selection

    ![](images/image23.png)

-   Toggle layer on and off to ensure that the polygon selected does not cover any building on the xyz tiles osm map

-   If the feature highlighted is a silver (does not cover any buildings), delete it, or adjust the vector according to the OSM background

    ![](images/image61.png)

-   For the thin strip shown above, we will remove it and assume the people in the 2 half-flooded buildings will go to the polygon near the river to collect their supplies, so the centroid moves northeast where 6 buildings are

    ![](images/image19.png)

We hence shorten it to produce this

![](images/image119.png)

-   From the menu bar, go to Vector → Geometry tools → Centroids

    -   Set the input layer as the clipped layer you just edited, and check 'Create centroid for each part' as some features contain multiple polygons.

        ![](images/image135.png)

-   Open the centroid layer's attribute table

-   Open field calculator

    -   Check update existing field, select fid from the field dropdown, use \@id as the expression, then click OK.

        ![](images/image152.png)

-   Untoggle pencil icon editing mode to save the changes

-   Close the attribute table

-   Save to geopackage as flood_neighbourhood_centroids

Here's what it looks like:
